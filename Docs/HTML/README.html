<p>UMLS::Interface</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</a></h2>
<pre>
    This package provides a Perl interface to UMLS, a taxonomy of
    medical concepts. The package is set up to access UMLS present in
    a mysql database. The package was essentially created for use with
    the Semantic::Similarity package for measuring the semantic
    relatedness of concepts.</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="install">INSTALL</a></h2>
<pre>
    To install the module, run the following magic commands:</pre>
<pre>
      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install</pre>
<pre>
    This will install the module in the standard location. You will, most
    probably, require root privileges to install in standard system
    directories. To install in a non-standard directory, specify a prefix
    during the 'perl Makefile.PL' stage as:</pre>
<pre>
      perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/sid</pre>
<pre>
    It is possible to modify other parameters during installation. The
    details of these can be found in the ExtUtils::MakeMaker
    documentation. However, it is highly recommended not messing around
    with other parameters, unless you know what you're doing.</pre>
<pre>
    Next set the UMLSINTERFACE environment variable</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="database_setup">DATABASE SETUP</a></h2>
<pre>
    The interface assumes that the UMLS is present as a mysql database. 
    The names of these databases can be passed as configuration options 
    at initialization. However, if the names of the database is not 
    provided at initialization, then default values are used -- the 
    database for the UMLS is called 'umls'.</pre>
<pre>
    The UMLS database must contain four tables: 
        1. MRREL
        2. MRCONSO
        3. MRSAB
        4. MRDOC</pre>
<pre>
    All other tables in the databases will be ignored, and any of these
    tables missing would raise an error.</pre>
<pre>
    The mysql server can be on the same machine as the module or could
    be on a remotely accessible machine. The location of the server can
    be provided during initialization of the module.</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="initializing_the_module">INITIALIZING THE MODULE</a></h2>
<pre>
    To create an instance of the interface object, using default values for
    all configuration options:</pre>
<pre>
      use UMLS::Interface;
      my $interface = UMLS::Interface-&gt;new();</pre>
<pre>
    Configuration options can be included in the MySQL my.cnf 
    file. This is preferable. The directions for this are in 
    the INSTALL file. It is Stage 5 Step D.</pre>
<pre>
    The following configuration options are also provided though:</pre>
<pre>
    'driver'       -&gt; Default value 'mysql'. This option specifies the 
                      Perl DBD driver that should be used to access the
                      database. This implies that the some other DBMS
                      system (such as PostgresSQL) could also be used,
                      as long as there exist Perl DBD drivers to
                      access the database.
    'umls'         -&gt; Default value 'umls'. This option specifes the name
                      of the UMLS database.
    'hostname'     -&gt; Default value 'localhost'. The name or the IP 
                      address of the machine on which the database 
                      server is running.
    'socket'       -&gt; Default value '/tmp/mysql.sock'. The socket on 
                      which the database server is using.
    'port'         -&gt; The port number on which the database server 
                      accepts connections.
    'username'     -&gt; Username to use to connect to the database server. 
                      If not provided, the module attempts to connect as 
                      an anonymous user.
    'password'     -&gt; Password for access to the database server. If not
                      provided, the module attempts to access the server
                      without a password.</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="using_the_module">USING THE MODULE</a></h2>
<pre>
    Once the object of module is successfully created after following the
    steps described in the previous section, a number of methods can be
    called upon this object:</pre>
<pre>
      getError()                -- Returns the error code and error string from 
                                   the last method call on the object.
      root()                    -- Returns the concept ID of the root of the tree.
      depth()                   -- Returns the depth of the tree.
      version()                 -- Return the version of UMLS.
      exists()                  -- Determines if a CUI exists
      validCui()                -- Checks if CUI is a valid concept
      getSab()                  -- Returns the list of sources the concept
                                   exists in
      getConceptList()          -- Returns the list of all concept IDs preset in
                                   the database.
      getTermsList()            -- Returns the list of terms corresponding to a 
                                   particular concept ID.
      getParents()              -- Returns the parent of a given CUI
      getChildren()             -- Returns the children of a given CUI
      pathsToRoot()             -- Returns a list of concept IDs that denote 
                                   the path from the input concept ID to the 
                                   root 
                                   concept of the taxonomy.
      findShortestPath()        -- Returns the shortest path between two CUIs
      findLeastCommonSubsumer() -- Returns the least common subsumer between
                                   two CUIs
      getCuiDef                 -- Returns the definition(s) of a given CUI
      getStDef                  -- Returns the definition of a given ST
      dropTable                 -- Drops the temporary table created by 
                                   the UMLS-Interface module of path information
                                   for a specified set of sources</pre>
<pre>
    These methods essentially expose an interface as required by the
    UMLS::Similarity modules. The UMLS::Similarity modules require
    that any interface to a taxonomy provide the above methods.</pre>
