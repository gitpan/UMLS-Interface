The following scripts require "keys" for the tests to run correctly:

findCuiDepth.t
findDFS.t
findLeastCommonSubsumer.t
findPathToRoot.t
findShortestPath.t
getAssociatedCuis.t
getAssociatedTerms.t
getChildren.t
getCuiDef.t
getCuiList.t
getIC.t
getParents.t
getRelated.t
getRelations.t
getStDef.t
getSts.t

Each of these scripts co-incide with a program in the util/ directory
under the same name. If a key does not exist for the version of the 
UMLS that you are using. They will automatically be created in key/ 
under the directory of your version.
