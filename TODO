NAME
    Todo List for UMLS-Interface

SYNOPSIS
    Plans for future versions of UMLS-Interface

DESCRIPTION
    1. Allow for back compatability of UMLS versions
    2. Fail gracefully in the test cases when the problem is that the
    username/password ect ... is not set
    3. concurrency control so that while a table is in the process of being
    created it can not be used by used by another program.
    4. better concurrency control so that multiple versions of the same
    table are not constructed at the same time.
    5. Shorten table names
    6. Reduce storage of path information
