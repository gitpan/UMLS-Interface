NAME
    Todo List for UMLS-Interface

SYNOPSIS
    Plans for future versions of UMLS-Interface

TO DO LIST
    1. concurrency control so that while a table is in the process of being
    created it can not be used by used by another program.

    2. seperate out the SABDEF and the SAB functions. I was thinking of a
    DefFinder.pm module to contain this information. I didn't get around to
    actually completing it. It will take a little bit given how everything
    is so coupled together. I might try this in the future.
