SYNOPSIS
    Listing the frequently asked questions about the UMLS-Interface package.

DESCRIPTION
  Functionality related questions :
   What relations should I use?
    You can use any of the relations exist in the sources that you specified
    in the configuration file. The directional relations though are PAR/CHD
    and RB/RN. The other relations (such as RO and SIB) are not directional
    which means when obtaining path information when using these relations
    may take quite a long time.

  Package related questions :
   What is the UMLS?
    The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is a knowledge representation
    framework designed to support biomedical and clinical research. It
    includes over 100 knowledge sources and classification systems encoded
    with different semantic and syntactic structures. The three major
    components of UMLS are the Metathesaurus, Semantic Network and
    SPECIALIST Lexicon.

   I have used this software and want to cite it. How should I do that?
    If you write a paper that has used UMLS-Interface in some way, we'd
    certainly be grateful if you sent us a copy and referenced
    UMLS-Interface. We have a published paper that provides a suitable
    reference:

     @inproceedings{McInnesPP09,
     title={{UMLS-Interface and UMLS-Similarity : Open Source Software for Measuring Paths and Semantic Similarity}}, 
     author={McInnes, B.T. and Pedersen, T. and Pakhomov, S.V.}, 
     booktitle={Proceedings of the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) Symposium},
     year={2009}, 
     month={November}, 
     address={San Fransico, CA} }

   What is the earlist version of the UMLS that I can use?
    The package has been run and tested using UMLS 2008AA. We have plans to
    make this compatable with earlier versions of the UMLS and do our best
    to ensure that the package remains updated for future versions.
