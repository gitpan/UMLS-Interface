NAME
    UMLS::Interface CHANGES

  Changes from version 0.13 to 0.15
    Added three new functions for semantic types:

          getSt       which returns the semantic type TUI of a given CUI
          getStAbr    which returns the semantic type abbreviation 
                      given the semantic type TUI
          getStString which returns the semantic type string 
                      given the semantic type abbreviation

    Added a program to the utils/ directory:

          getSt.pl    which returns the semantic type of a given CUI
                      or TERM in the UMLS. This program uses the three 
                      above functions.
      
    Added the function checkConceptExists which returns true or false
    whether a concept exists in the current view of the UMLS (this is based
    on the sources and relations that are being used). This function was
    hidden but it seemed like it could be useful to others as well - it
    became useful for me anyway :)

    Modified the SYNOPSIS section in the Interface.pm module to include all
    or at least most of the different functions available through the
    Interface.pm module.

    Fixed the permissions on the configuration file directory when it is
    being created. And chmod the individual files after they were created.
    Hopefully now they will be created with read and write privlidges so you
    can see them if you install using the -MCPAN option.

    Modified the findPathToRoot.pl and findShortestPath.pl to include the
    term associated with the CUI in the path

    I forgot to add the UMLS Root to the PATH in the pathToRoot function. It
    is now added.

  Changes from version 0.11 to 0.13
    Speed up the getTermList() option when all of the sources are being used

    Modified documentation

    Added the function findMinimumDepth and findMaximumDepth which returns
    the minimum and maximum depth of a CUI respectively given the view of
    the UMLS

  Changes from version 0.09 to 0.11
    Modified the Changelog directory and tried to remember to add them to
    the release!

    Modified documenation - tried to get the misspelling and obvious errors
    removed.

    Removed the HTML documentation

  Changes from version 0.03 to 0.09
    Allowed the program to create the directory that we prompt the user for
    (the location that the config files should be stored) if it doesn't
    exist rather than requiring it be already created.

    Modified the location of where the utils/ programs are installed. All of
    them now get installed and they are all in the same location.

    Found a bug in the code that reads the configuration file. Error would
    occur if trying to exclude a source.

  Changes from version 0.01 to 0.03
    Removed the need for UMLSINTERFACE environment variable indicating the
    location of the UMLS. Now we prompt the user for the location that the
    config files should be stored and ask them to set a
    UMLSINTERFACE_CONFIGFILE_DIR variable.
