NAME
    UMLS::Interface CHANGES

  Changes from version 0.09 to 0.11
    Modified the Changelog directory and tried to remember to add them to
    the release!

    Modified documenation - tried to get the misspelling and obvious errors
    removed.

    Removed the HTML documentation

  Changes from version 0.03 to 0.09
    Allowed the program to create the directory that we prompt the user for
    (the location that the config files should be stored) if it doesn't
    exist rather than requiring it be already created.

    Modified the location of where the utils/ programs are installed. All of
    them now get installed and they are all in the same location.

    Found a bug in the code that reads the configuration file. Error would
    occur if trying to exclude a source.

  Changes from version 0.01 to 0.03
    Removed the need for UMLSINTERFACE environment variable indicating the
    location of the UMLS. Now we prompt the user for the location that the
    config files should be stored and ask them to set a
    UMLSINTERFACE_CONFIGFILE_DIR variable.
